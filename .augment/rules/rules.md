# Chrome Extension Development Rules

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

### 1. COMPLETE FILE READING (ABSOLUTE RULE)
- Read ENTIRE file before making ANY changes
- Understand ALL existing functionality and dependencies
- Never edit based on partial understanding

### 2. BULK EDITING REQUIREMENT
- Edit files in bulk operations, never one line at a time
- Plan ALL changes before implementing any changes
- Address related issues together in single operations

### 3. CENTRALIZED ARCHITECTURE
- NO fallback patterns using `||` operators with hardcoded strings
- ALL user-facing messages from centralized message system
- ALL configuration from centralized config system
- Remove ALL fallback patterns systematically across entire codebase

### 4. PYLANCE COMPATIBILITY (CRITICAL)
- Always use proper Python type hints
- Fix ALL Pylance errors before claiming work is complete
- Use `Set[str]`, `list[str]`, `-> int` for type annotations
- Never ignore Pylance warnings - they indicate real issues

### 5. GIT WORKFLOW REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)
- ALWAYS use git.sh tool instead of raw git commands
- Standard workflow: `./git.sh 1 "msg"` â†’ `./git.sh 2` â†’ `./git.sh 3` â†’ `./git.sh 4`
- Update ALL references when changing file names or paths
- Check pre-commit and post-commit hooks when modifying tools
- git.sh must ALWAYS remain on develop branch - NEVER delete from develop

### 6. PRODUCTION QUALITY STANDARDS (ABSOLUTE)
- Every line of code must be production-ready
- Complete error handling and user feedback systems
- No amateur shortcuts or quick fixes that compromise quality
- Systematic testing - verify all functionality works correctly
- Tools must be 100% accurate - no false positives or negatives

### 7. NATURAL LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)
- Write naturally, avoid AI-like language patterns
- Never use: "comprehensive," "significant," "discover," "diving deep"
- Be direct and clear without corporate buzzwords or marketing speak
- Write for humans who need real information, not AI-generated content

### 8. VALIDATION TOOL ACCURACY (MANDATORY)
- i18n validation tool must be completely accurate with zero false positives
- Enhanced pattern detection covers all usage scenarios including smart detection
- Comprehensive file scanning across all directories and file types
- Proper Pylance type hints with Set[str], List[str], Dict[str, Any] annotations
- Tool must find ALL actual usage patterns with 100% accuracy
- Must show all locales and their key counts with proper categorization

### 9. SYSTEMATIC PROBLEM SOLVING (REQUIRED)
- Fix root causes, not symptoms or individual issues
- Use sequential thinking tool for complex architectural problems
- Work through issues systematically one by one with proper testing
- Complete solutions only - no partial implementations or quick fixes

### 10. TOOL INTEGRATION (CRITICAL)
- Update ALL hook files when changing tool names or paths
- Check pre-commit, post-commit, and git.sh references systematically
- Ensure tools work with CI/CD pipelines and return proper exit codes
- Test tools thoroughly before claiming completion - verify they actually work

### 11. DIRECT COMMUNICATION (REQUIRED)
- No flattery or positive adjectives like "good", "great", "excellent"
- Direct responses, skip pleasantries and unnecessary praise
- Focus on actionable information and concrete solutions
- Lead with the most important information, not filler content

### 12. ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS (ABSOLUTE)
- Never claim work is complete without thorough verification
- Check ALL Pylance errors before finishing any Python work
- Verify tools actually work as intended by testing them
- Test that "unused" keys are truly unused by searching entire codebase
- Manual verification required for all tool outputs

### 13. CENTRALIZED SYSTEMS (MANDATORY)
- `window.GPTPF_I18N.getMessage()` for all translations - no exceptions
- `GPTPF_CONFIG` for all configuration settings
- `GPTPF_DEBUG` for all logging and debug output
- No hardcoded strings anywhere in components, HTML, or JavaScript

### 14. FILE STRUCTURE (REQUIRED)
- Develop branch = ALL files including development tools and scripts
- Main branch = Production files only, no development artifacts
- Use proper signature headers in all source code files
- Maintain consistent naming conventions across all project files
- git.sh must ALWAYS remain on develop branch - NEVER delete from develop

### 15. VALIDATION PATTERNS (COMPREHENSIVE)
- Check HTML data attributes: `data-i18n`, `data-i18n-html`, `data-i18n-placeholder`
- Check JavaScript getMessage patterns and GPTPF_DEBUG calls
- Check manifest.json __MSG__ patterns for Chrome extension i18n
- Include dynamic key families in validation logic
- Show all supported locales (en, ar, sw, es, ja, fr, ru, zh, pt, de, hi) with key counts

### 16. i18n TRANSLATION WORKFLOW (MANDATORY)
- ALL translations must be systematic chunk-by-chunk from English source
- Use 175-200 line chunks for maximum efficiency and speed
- NEVER translate brand names (Multi-AI File Paster, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- PRESERVE all placeholders and complex JSON structures exactly
- Work from English _locales/en/messages.json as single source of truth
- Must achieve 100% completion (all keys) with valid JSON structure
- Validate JSON syntax and key count after completion

### 17. SYSTEMATIC APPROACH (ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT)
- Read large chunks from source file (175-200 lines recommended)
- Translate complete chunks at once for efficiency
- Continue systematically until ALL keys translated (no exceptions)
- User demands complete work - partial translations are unacceptable
- Time and resource efficiency through bulk operations, not tiny chunks

### 18. BRAND NAME PRESERVATION (CRITICAL)
- Extension name "Multi-AI File Paster" stays English in ALL languages
- Platform names (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Grok) stay English
- Company names and technical terms remain untranslated
- Only translate user-facing descriptive text and UI messages
- BETA must be translated to proper language equivalents (not left as English)

### 19. JSON STRUCTURE INTEGRITY (MANDATORY)
- Maintain exact placeholder structure with content/$1 and example fields
- Preserve all HTML markup and special formatting in messages
- Keep all debug messages and technical strings properly formatted
- Final validation must show all keys matching English exactly

### 20. UI TEXT LENGTH OPTIMIZATION (CRITICAL)
- ONLY shorten UI elements that affect layout: buttons, toggles, badges, dropdowns
- NEVER shorten descriptive text, tooltips, modals, or configuration descriptions
- Match English character/word count for UI elements to maintain professional design
- Keep full quality descriptions for help text, explanations, and modal content
- Focus on button/toggle text that causes container overflow or layout breaking

### 21. NEW LANGUAGE ADDITION WORKFLOW (COMPREHENSIVE REQUIREMENT)
- COMPLETE process required when adding any new language to extension
- Create _locales/{lang_code}/messages.json with all keys from English source
- Update src/shared/i18n.js with new language in ALL validation functions
- Update popup language dropdown with new flag CSS and option element
- Apply SHORT UI text methodology following established patterns
- Test language switching functionality thoroughly before completion
- Verify all platform integrations work properly with new language

### 22. MEMORY AND RULES UPDATES (CRITICAL)
- ALWAYS update rules.md when learning new requirements from user
- When user provides new instructions, add them to rules immediately
- Keep rules current with all user preferences and requirements
- Rules must be complete reference for all development standards
- Update memories AND rules together - never update one without the other

### 23. DOCUMENTATION AUDIT REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL)
- **COMPLETE FILE READING**: Read ENTIRE documentation file before making ANY changes
- **PURPOSE-SPECIFIC CONTENT**: Each documentation file serves different audiences (public vs internal vs technical)
- **STORE OPTIMIZATION**: Store/marketplace descriptions must be SEO-friendly, user-focused, concise
- **ACCURACY VERIFICATION**: All technical claims must be verified against actual codebase implementation
- **AUDIENCE TARGETING**: Public docs focus on user benefits, internal docs on development processes, technical docs on implementation details
- **CONTENT REDUCTION**: Remove technical implementation details from public-facing documentation
- **SEO OPTIMIZATION**: Use clear headings, bullet points, and user-focused language for store listings
- **CONSISTENCY MAINTENANCE**: Ensure all documentation reflects current project state
- **VERSION ACCURACY**: Correct version history and feature descriptions
- **COMPLETE FILE COVERAGE**: Document ALL utilities and shared components
- **LEGAL FILE ACCURACY**: LICENSE, NOTICE, and all legal files must reflect current project state

### 24. WORD LIMIT SAFETY AND ACCURACY (CRITICAL)
- Maximum word limit is 15,000 words - safe and tested
- Minimum word limit is 50 words - prevents accidental triggers
- Verify limits are accurate in: src/shared/config.js (VALIDATION_LIMITS), src/popup/index.html (input max attribute), all locale files (config_auto_attach message)
- All references must show "50-15,000 words" consistently
- Never use different limits in different parts of codebase
