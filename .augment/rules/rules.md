**There are no shortcuts in quality software development. Every component must meet standards for reliability, usability, and clarity.**

## üõ†Ô∏è TOOL USAGE MASTERY (CRITICAL)

### 22. AUGMENT CONTEXT ENGINE EXPERTISE
**Master the world's best codebase context engine for maximum efficiency.**

The Augment context engine is the most powerful tool available. Use it strategically:

**When to Use codebase-retrieval:**
- Finding specific functions, classes, or patterns across the entire codebase
- Understanding how similar features were implemented previously
- Locating configuration files, message systems, or centralized utilities
- Getting comprehensive context about unfamiliar code sections
- Always use BEFORE making any edits to understand existing patterns

**Advanced Usage Patterns:**
- Use specific, detailed queries: "Find all toast message implementations and centralized message usage patterns"
- Search for architectural patterns: "Show me how file attachment is handled across different platforms"
- Locate related functionality: "Find all batch processing logic and configuration settings"

**When to Use git-commit-retrieval:**
- Understanding how similar changes were made in the past
- Learning from previous implementation patterns
- Finding the history of specific features or bug fixes
- Understanding the evolution of architectural decisions

### 23. SEQUENTIAL THINKING TOOL MASTERY
**Always use thinking tool for complex problems - you must be the expert.**

**Mandatory Usage Scenarios:**
- Any architectural decisions affecting multiple files
- Complex debugging that involves system interactions
- When user mentions "deep work", "think hard", or "don't rush"
- State management issues or bidirectional control problems
- Integration challenges between different system components
- Performance optimization or security considerations

**Advanced Thinking Patterns:**
- Question initial assumptions and explore alternatives
- Consider system-wide impact of proposed changes
- Plan comprehensive solutions before implementing
- Verify that fixes address root causes, not symptoms
- Break complex problems into logical, manageable steps

### 24. PARALLEL TOOL EXECUTION MASTERY
**Maximize efficiency through strategic parallel tool calls.**

**Always Use Parallel Calls For:**
- Reading multiple files simultaneously
- Running multiple view commands for different directories
- Executing multiple search operations across different areas
- Checking multiple configuration files at once
- Gathering comprehensive context from different sources

**Strategic Parallel Patterns:**
```
‚úÖ Read 5 related files simultaneously
‚úÖ Search multiple directories for patterns at once
‚úÖ Check configuration, messages, and validation files together
‚úÖ Gather context from different system components in parallel
```

### 25. FILE OPERATION TOOL EXPERTISE
**Master efficient file reading and editing patterns.**

**View Tool Mastery:**
- Use regex search for finding specific patterns within files
- Use view_range for large files when you need specific sections
- Always read complete files before editing - never make assumptions
- Use directory views to understand project structure quickly

**str-replace-editor Tool Mastery:**
- Always read complete files first using view tool
- Plan ALL changes before making ANY edits
- Use bulk editing operations - never edit one line at a time
- Make related changes together in single operations
- Always include instruction_reminder for edit size limits

### 26. ANALYTICS DESIGN REQUIREMENTS (CHROME EXTENSION SPECIFIC)
**Analytics must be optimized for popup space with multiple chart options.**

**Chart Design Standards:**
- Multiple chart types available (line, bar, area charts)
- Chart selection system for user choice
- Optimized for popup space constraints - reduce excessive padding
- Professional Tailwind-inspired design using root variables
- Interactive elements with hover effects and smooth transitions

**Popup Optimization:**
- Reduce padding throughout analytics design
- Clearing spinner must be properly centered
- Charts must handle large datasets without performance issues
- Visual hierarchy optimized for small popup space
- Professional styling that matches extension's design system

### 27. PROFESSIONAL SIGNATURE HEADERS (MANDATORY)
**All code files must include comprehensive, license-protected signature headers.**

**Header Requirements:**
- Include complete project identification and version
- List full development team: Joseph Matino (Lead Developer), Majok Deng (Scrum Master)
- Specify technical architecture and security approach
- Document performance optimizations and browser compatibility
- Include comprehensive legal compliance with anti-piracy protection
- Provide WekTurbo Designs - Hostwek LTD organization information
- Add deterrent against code theft and unauthorized copying

### 28. LINUX COMMAND REQUIREMENT (MANDATORY)
**Always use Linux-style commands in terminal operations.**

**Command Standards:**
- ALL terminal commands must be formatted for Linux/Unix systems
- Use forward slashes (/) for paths, not backslashes (\)
- Use Linux-style command syntax and options
- This applies regardless of user's operating system

**Examples:**
```bash
‚úÖ ls -la src/components/
‚úÖ cd src/shared && npm install
‚úÖ grep -r "function" src/
‚úÖ find . -name "*.js" -type f
‚ùå dir src\components\
‚ùå cd src\shared & npm install
‚ùå findstr "function" src\*
```

**Implementation:**
- Assume Linux environment for all command suggestions
- Use standard Unix/Linux tools and syntax
- Format file paths with forward slashes
- Use Linux-style environment variables and shell operators

### 29. CRITICAL FILE READING PROHIBITIONS
**Absolute prohibitions that must never be violated.**

**STRICTLY PROHIBITED Actions:**
- NEVER use view_range with line numbers like "Read lines 1-50"
- NEVER read partial file ranges or excerpts
- NEVER make assumptions about code structure without reading complete files
- NEVER edit files based on incomplete understanding
- NEVER respond as if it's a new conversation in the same chat session

**MANDATORY Actions:**
- ALWAYS read complete files using view tool without line ranges
- ALWAYS maintain conversation context and remember previous work
- ALWAYS understand full file structure before making any edits
- ALWAYS remember project patterns established earlier in the conversation
- ALWAYS build on previous knowledge within the same chat session

**There are no shortcuts in quality software development. Every component must meet standards for reliability, usability, and clarity.**

### 30. COMPLETE CODE REQUIREMENT (CRITICAL)
**NEVER create unfinished, incomplete, or poor quality code.**

**Mandatory Code Quality Standards:**
- ALWAYS test code before delivering - run syntax checks, compilation tests
- NEVER leave Unicode encoding errors, syntax errors, or runtime errors
- NEVER create files with missing functionality or incomplete implementations
- ALWAYS use proper type annotations in Python (Dict[str, int], List[str], etc.)
- ALWAYS handle encoding properly - use UTF-8 encoding declarations
- NEVER use amateur shortcuts or placeholder code

**Code Completion Verification:**
- Run syntax validation: `python -c "import ast; ast.parse(open('file.py', encoding='utf-8').read())"`
- Test functionality: Execute the code to verify it works correctly
- Check encoding: Ensure no Unicode errors or character encoding issues
- Verify imports: All required imports must be present and correct
- Complete implementation: No TODO comments, no placeholder functions

**Professional Standards:**
- Every function must be complete and working
- Every file must compile without errors
- Every script must execute successfully
- Every feature must be fully implemented
- No half-finished work is acceptable

### 31. MCP TOOL USAGE REQUIREMENT (MANDATORY)
**Use MCP tools when available; external ai-scripts have been removed.**

**Current Options:**
- Built-in MCP server commands (e.g., documentation and platform analyzers)
- License header audit: `license_audit` (checks Hostwek Custom banner presence)
- Optional: Reintroduce a simplified analysis toolchain if needed

**When to Use MCP Tools:**
- ALWAYS run project analysis before making architectural changes
- ALWAYS check i18n coverage when working with translations
- ALWAYS use analysis tools to understand project health and issues
- Use tools to provide data-driven development recommendations
- Run analysis after major changes to verify project integrity
 - Before releases, run `license_audit` to ensure header consistency

**Integration Requirements:**
- Use MCP analysis results to inform development decisions
- Reference analysis data when providing recommendations
- Include analysis output in development reports
- Use tools to identify areas needing improvement

**Tool Output Integration:**
- Always interpret and explain analysis results for the user
