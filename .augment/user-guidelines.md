# Universal AI Development Guidelines
## Internal Quality Standards for All Software Projects

This document contains universal development standards that apply to ALL software projects across web applications, Chrome extensions, mobile apps, desktop software, and any other development work. These guidelines ensure consistent, production-quality code and efficient AI-assisted development.

## üö® CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY)

### 1. COMPLETE FILE READING REQUIREMENT (ABSOLUTE RULE)
**NEVER edit ANY file without reading it COMPLETELY first.**

**What this means:**
- Read the ENTIRE file from start to finish before making ANY changes
- Understand ALL existing functionality, dependencies, and architectural patterns
- Identify ALL errors and their root causes systematically
- Comprehend the complete structure and context before implementing solutions
- Even for single-line edits, read the whole file to understand integration points

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents breaking existing functionality and introducing regression bugs
- Avoids creating new errors or architectural inconsistencies
- Ensures changes fit seamlessly into the overall system architecture
- Prevents hallucinated solutions that don't match actual code structure
- Maintains internal development standards and code quality

**Implementation Standards:**
- Use view tool to read FULL files, never make assumptions about code structure
- Never edit based on partial understanding or incomplete context
- Always understand the complete context and dependencies before editing
- Verify that proposed changes align with existing patterns and conventions

### 2. BULK EDITING REQUIREMENT (EFFICIENCY STANDARD)
**Edit files in bulk operations, never one line at a time.**

**What this means:**
- Read complete file first, then make ALL necessary changes in single operation
- Use systematic bulk edits that address multiple related issues simultaneously
- Never waste time with incremental line-by-line edits that slow development
- Plan all changes comprehensively before implementing any changes

**Why this matters:**
- Saves time and increases development efficiency
- Ensures consistent changes across related code sections and modules
- Reduces risk of missing related changes or creating inconsistencies
- Maintains steady development pace and productivity standards

**Implementation Standards:**
- Plan complete changes before making any edits
- Address related issues together in coordinated bulk operations
- Maintain consistent patterns across similar code sections
- Use systematic approach to ensure completeness and quality

### 3. CENTRALIZED ARCHITECTURE (NO FALLBACKS)
**ALL configuration, messages, and settings MUST be centralized.**

**Universal Requirements:**
- NO fallback patterns using `||` operators with hardcoded strings
- NO hardcoded text anywhere in components, HTML, or JavaScript
- ALL user-facing messages from centralized message system
- ALL configuration from centralized config system
- When centralizing, update ALL instances across entire codebase systematically

**Core Patterns:**
```javascript
‚úÖ getMessage('CATEGORY', 'KEY')
‚úÖ const config = getCentralizedConfig()
‚úÖ textContent = getUIText('COMPONENT', 'LABEL')
‚úÖ console.log(getLogMessage('CATEGORY', 'EVENT'))
```

**Implementation Standards:**
- Remove ALL fallback patterns systematically across entire codebase
- Update ALL components to use centralized systems exclusively
- Test that functionality works correctly without fallbacks
- Use natural, human language in messages - no generic AI language
- Create logical message categories that make sense for the project type

### 4. SYSTEMATIC PROBLEM SOLVING
**Fix root causes, not symptoms.**

**Implementation Standards:**
- Don't patch individual errors - fix the underlying architecture
- If multiple files have the same issue, fix it systematically across all files
- Use centralized systems instead of individual module detection
- Complete 100% of functionality - no partial implementations

**Examples:**
- ‚úÖ Fix architecture to load dependencies properly
- ‚ùå Add fallback patterns to individual files
- ‚úÖ Use centralized configuration system
- ‚ùå Add custom detection in each module

### 5. PRODUCTION QUALITY STANDARDS
**Every line of code must be production-ready.**

**Quality Requirements:**
- No amateur shortcuts or quick fixes that compromise quality
- Complete error handling and user feedback systems
- Complete functionality - every feature must work properly
- Proper integration - all modules work together seamlessly
- Established patterns - follow existing engineering practices

- Target production quality with detailed error identification
- Complete solutions only - no half-measures or partial implementations
- Continue to next logical steps without asking permission for obvious fixes

### 7. DEEP THINKING REQUIREMENT
**Always use sequential thinking tool for complex problems.**

**When to Use Thinking Tool:**
- When user asks for "deep work" or mentions multiple interconnected issues

- NEVER use raw git commands like 'git commit', 'git push', 'git tag' if git.sh exists
- If git.sh doesn't support an operation, add it to git.sh rather than using raw git
- Maintain consistent workflow across all projects

**Standard Workflow (when git.sh available):**
1. `./git.sh 1 "commit message"` - Commit changes
2. `./git.sh 2` - Push to develop branch
3. `./git.sh 3` - Update main from develop
4. `./git.sh 4 v1.2.0 "description"` - Create release tag

**Branch Structure Standards:**
- Develop branch = ALL files including development tools
- Main branch = Production files only

- Think before acting - Analyze the problem systematically before making changes
- Question assumptions - Challenge initial approaches and consider alternatives
- Plan comprehensively - Break down complex tasks into logical steps
- Verify solutions - Check that fixes address root causes, not just symptoms

**Architecture Understanding Requirements:**
- Read ALL files completely before making ANY changes - no exceptions
- Understand existing patterns before adding new functions or logic
- Identify centralized systems - Use existing architecture instead of creating duplicates
- Map dependencies - Understand how components interact before modifying them
- Respect established patterns - Follow existing conventions and design patterns

**State Management Rules:**
- Avoid duplicate functions - One centralized function is better than multiple partial ones
- Comprehensive state checks - Consider ALL conditions, not just partial states
- Bidirectional control - Ensure state changes work in both directions
- Systematic conflict resolution - Handle competing states methodically
- Centralized over distributed - Use centralized state management when possible

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Fix architecture, not symptoms - Address underlying design issues
- Eliminate duplicate logic - Consolidate conflicting functions
- Systematic state management - One source of truth for each state
- Error handling - Full validation and user feedback

### 16. ARCHITECTURAL THINKING REQUIREMENTS
**Always consider full system architecture impact.**

**System Impact Analysis:**
- When fixing one component, consider how it affects all interconnected files
- Understand the role of main controllers in the architecture
- Shared files and utilities are used by multiple components
- Fix shared systems properly so all dependent files work correctly
- Don't deteriorate existing work by making incomplete architectural fixes
- Understand file relationships before making changes

**Architecture Principles:**
- Single responsibility principle - each module has one clear purpose
- Dependency inversion - depend on abstractions, not concretions
- Open/closed principle - open for extension, closed for modification
- Interface segregation - many specific interfaces better than one general
- Don't repeat yourself (DRY) - eliminate duplicate code and logic

### 17. STATE MANAGEMENT AND UI CONTROLS
**Bidirectional control systems must work both ways.**

**Control System Standards:**
- When one toggle disables another, the reverse must also work properly
- Use existing badge systems matching existing design, not inline CSS styling
- All disabled controls must show visual feedback (opacity, cursor, badges)
- State management functions must properly re-enable controls when conditions change
- Never leave controls permanently disabled due to poor state management logic
- Remove badges when controls are re-enabled, don't leave orphaned badges

**UI Consistency Requirements:**
- Consistent visual feedback across all interactive elements
- Clear indication of why controls are disabled
- Styling that matches overall design system
- Accessible controls that work with screen readers and keyboard navigation

## üõ†Ô∏è TOOL USAGE MASTERY (CRITICAL)

- Understanding how similar features were implemented previously
- Locating configuration files, message systems, or centralized utilities
- Getting comprehensive context about unfamiliar code sections
- Always use BEFORE making any edits to understand existing patterns

**Advanced Usage Patterns:**
- Use specific, detailed queries: "Find all toast message implementations and centralized message usage patterns"
- Search for architectural patterns: "Show me how file attachment is handled across different platforms"
- Locate related functionality: "Find all batch processing logic and configuration settings"

**When to Use git-commit-retrieval:**
- Understanding how similar changes were made in the past
- Learning from previous implementation patterns
- Finding the history of specific features or bug fixes
- Understanding the evolution of architectural decisions

**Advanced Thinking Patterns:**
- Question initial assumptions and explore alternatives
- Consider system-wide impact of proposed changes
- Plan comprehensive solutions before implementing
- Verify that fixes address root causes, not symptoms
- Break complex problems into logical, manageable steps

### 20. PARALLEL TOOL EXECUTION MASTERY
**Maximize efficiency through strategic parallel tool calls.**

**Always Use Parallel Calls For:**
- Reading multiple files simultaneously
- Running multiple view commands for different directories
- Executing multiple search operations across different areas
- Checking multiple configuration files at once
- Gathering comprehensive context from different sources

**Strategic Parallel Patterns:**
```
‚úÖ Read 5 related files simultaneously
‚úÖ Search multiple directories for patterns at once
‚úÖ Check configuration, messages, and validation files together
‚úÖ Gather context from different system components in parallel
```

### 21. FILE OPERATION TOOL EXPERTISE
**Master efficient file reading and editing patterns.**

**View Tool Mastery:**
- Use regex search for finding specific patterns within files

- Always read complete files before editing - never make assumptions
- Use directory views to understand project structure quickly

**str-replace-editor Tool Mastery:**
- Always read complete files first using view tool
- Plan ALL changes before making ANY edits
- Use bulk editing operations - never edit one line at a time
- Make related changes together in single operations
- Always include instruction_reminder for edit size limits

### 22. MCP PIPELINE TOOLS MASTERY
**Leverage specialized MCP tools for maximum productivity.**

**CircleCI MCP Tools:**
- Use for CI/CD pipeline management and debugging
- Integrate with existing git workflows

- **Context Gathering**: Parallel codebase-retrieval calls
- **Historical Understanding**: git-commit-retrieval + codebase-retrieval
- **Architecture Changes**: Thinking tool + comprehensive file reading

**Efficiency Principles:**
- Never use single tools when parallel execution is possible
- Always gather complete context before making changes
- Use the most powerful tools available (Augment context engine)

### 26. PROFESSIONAL SIGNATURE HEADERS (MANDATORY)
**All code files must include comprehensive, license-protected signature headers with your team information, anti-piracy protection, and complete legal compliance. Use the signature header template from RULES.md for all source code files.**
