Multi-AI File Paster is a free Chrome extension that automatically attaches and converts your pasted text into file attachments on AI platforms. The extension has two core features working together: **Auto-Attach** automatically creates file attachments when your pasted content exceeds your word threshold (default 500 words, adjustable 50-15,000), and **Auto-Convert** automatically detects the programming language or file type and assigns the correct extension (.js, .py, .sql, etc.). You paste normally and the extension handles everything automatically in the background.

```

Instead of manually creating text files and uploading them to AI platforms, you paste your text normally. The extension automatically detects when your content exceeds your threshold (auto-attach) and identifies the file type (auto-convert), then creates a properly formatted file attachment with syntax highlighting. This eliminates the tedious process of copying code, creating files, saving them, and uploading to ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, or Grok.

The extension works on Chrome, Edge, and Brave browsers. It recognizes 30+ file formats including Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++, Go, Rust, Swift, Kotlin, HTML, CSS, PHP, JSON, XML, SQL, CSV, YAML, Shell scripts, and more. All processing happens on your device - no data is sent to external servers. The extension requires no configuration, no subscriptions, no hidden costs, and works immediately after installation.

## 📖 How to Use

Multi-AI File Paster works automatically once installed. Navigate to any supported AI platform like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, or Grok, then paste your long content. When you paste text containing 500 or more words, it automatically detects the content format and creates a clean file attachment, keeping your conversation organized with properly formatted files.

For shorter content or immediate file creation, use manual controls. Press `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + S` to instantly attach your current text as a file, or click the "Attach typed text as file" button in the extension popup. This works perfectly for shorter code snippets or documents that you want formatted as files regardless of length.

Multi-AI File Paster offers flexible customization options to match your workflow. Adjust the word threshold anywhere from 50 to 15,000 words (default is 500 words). Enable the delay feature for 1-15 seconds with a cancel button if you want time to review before file creation. Choose between automatic format detection or manually select your preferred file type.

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

Multi-AI File Paster is designed to work reliably, but if you encounter issues, here are the most common solutions. If it isn't working, try refreshing the AI platform page and verify you're on a supported URL. When files aren't attaching automatically, check that your content meets the word count threshold (500+ words by default) and confirm the AI platform supports file uploads. If the wrong file format is detected, use manual format selection in settings or add code fences like ```python to your text. For settings that won't save, check your browser permissions and try disabling then re-enabling the extension.

---

## ❓ Common Questions

**"Wait, is this safe? I don't want my code sent to random servers."**

Your code never leaves your computer. This extension works exactly like manually creating a file and uploading it - no external servers, no data transmission. Everything happens locally in your browser.

**"I pasted my code but nothing happened. What's wrong?"**

Most likely your text is under 500 words (the default threshold). Check the extension popup - you can lower this to 50 words or disable it completely. Also make sure you're on a supported AI platform (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, or Grok).

**"It created a .txt file instead of .py for my Python code. How do I fix this?"**

The extension analyzes your code patterns to detect the language. For better detection, either use code fences like ```python in your text, or manually set the file format in the extension settings.

**"Does this work on all AI platforms?"**

Currently supports ChatGPT (both chat.openai.com and chatgpt.com), Claude (claude.ai), Google Gemini, DeepSeek, and Grok. Each platform has slightly different file upload systems, so the extension adapts accordingly.

**"I'm worried about privacy. What data do you collect?"**

By default, nothing. There's an optional analytics feature (disabled by default) that only tracks basic usage like "file created" - no content, no personal data. You can see exactly what's collected in the extension popup.

**"Can I turn off the automatic file creation?"**

Yes! You can disable auto-detection and use the manual "Save as File" button, or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+S. You can also add a delay with a cancel button.

**"Claude already has paste-to-file. Why do I need this?"**

Claude's feature is basic. This extension adds smart language detection, customizable word thresholds, batch processing, and works consistently across all AI platforms. You can also disable the extension on Claude if you prefer their native feature.

**"Does it support shell scripts and custom file extensions?"**

Yes! The extension supports .sh files and custom file extensions. You can choose from 30+ built-in formats or specify your own custom extension for specialized file types.

**"Why can't I see the analytics dashboard?"**

The analytics dashboard is only visible when anonymous usage analytics is enabled in settings. This ensures no data is processed unless you explicitly opt in. Enable it in the extension popup under Privacy settings to see your usage insights.
