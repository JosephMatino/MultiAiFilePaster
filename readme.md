Multi-AI File Paster is a completely free Chrome extension that automatically converts large text pastes into file attachments across all major AI platforms. Instead of manually creating text files and uploading them, this extension detects when your pasted content is too large or would benefit from file formatting, then instantly creates a properly formatted file attachment with syntax highlighting.

The core functionality eliminates the tedious workflow of copying large code, creating a new text file, saving it to your computer, then manually uploading it to AI platforms. Multi-AI File Paster handles this entire process automatically - you simply paste as normal, and the extension transforms your content into a clean, organized file attachment.

This free Chrome extension works seamlessly across Chromium-based browsers including Chrome, Edge, and Brave. Multi-AI File Paster recognizes 20+ different file formats including Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, JSON, CSV, SQL, Shell scripts, and more. All processing happens locally in your browser with zero external data transmission, ensuring complete privacy and security.

Multi-AI File Paster requires no configuration, no subscriptions, no hidden costs, and works immediately after installation. Simply paste your code or long text into any supported AI platform, and it automatically creates a clean file attachment, keeping your conversations organized and professional.

---

## üìñ How to Use

Multi-AI File Paster works automatically once installed. Navigate to any supported AI platform like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, or Grok, then paste your long content. When you paste text containing 500 or more words, it automatically detects the content format and creates a clean file attachment, keeping your conversation organized with properly formatted files.

For shorter content or immediate file creation, use manual controls. Press `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + S` to instantly attach your current text as a file, or click the "Attach typed text as file" button in the extension popup. This works perfectly for shorter code snippets or documents that you want formatted as files regardless of length.

Multi-AI File Paster offers flexible customization options to match your workflow. Adjust the word threshold anywhere from 50 to 15,000 words (default is 500 words). Enable the smart delay feature for 1-15 seconds with a cancel button if you want time to review before file creation. Choose between automatic format detection or manually select your preferred file type. Batch mode handles multiple code blocks in a single paste, while Claude override lets you choose between Claude's native paste-to-file feature or the extension's enhanced functionality.

### **üß† Smart Language Detection**

Multi-AI File Paster uses sophisticated pattern recognition to identify file formats accurately:

**How Detection Works:**
- **Pattern Analysis**: Examines syntax patterns, keywords, and code structure
- **Confidence Scoring**: Only applies detected format when confidence exceeds 35% threshold
- **Smart Fallback**: Defaults to .txt for ambiguous content to prevent mislabeling
- **Manual Override**: Use markdown code fences (```python) or select format in settings
- **Context Awareness**: Distinguishes between similar formats (e.g., C vs C++, HTML vs Markdown)

---

## ‚ö° Performance & Reliability

### **‚ö° Performance**

Multi-AI File Paster delivers exceptional performance with instant language detection that completes in under 100 milliseconds. It maintains a minimal memory footprint, using less than 2MB of RAM while running. File creation works completely offline with no internet connection required - you only need internet access for the AI platforms themselves. Full cross-platform support across Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.

## üîí **Privacy & Security**

Multi-AI File Paster prioritizes your privacy and security with comprehensive protection:

- **100% Local Processing**: All language analysis and file creation happens entirely on your device
- **Zero Data Transmission**: No data sent to external servers or third parties
- **Complete Privacy**: Your code and documents remain completely private
- **Chrome Manifest V3**: Built with latest Chrome security standards
- **Minimal Permissions**: Requests only essential permissions for core functionality

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

Multi-AI File Paster is designed to work reliably, but if you encounter issues, here are the most common solutions. If it isn't working, try refreshing the AI platform page and verify you're on a supported URL. When files aren't attaching automatically, check that your content meets the word count threshold (500+ words by default) and confirm the AI platform supports file uploads. If the wrong file format is detected, use manual format selection in settings or add code fences like ```python to your text. For settings that won't save, check your browser permissions and try disabling then re-enabling the extension.

---

## ‚ùì Common Questions

**"Wait, is this safe? I don't want my code sent to random servers."**

Your code never leaves your computer. This extension works exactly like manually creating a file and uploading it - no external servers, no data transmission. Everything happens locally in your browser.

**"I pasted my code but nothing happened. What's wrong?"**

Most likely your text is under 500 words (the default threshold). Check the extension popup - you can lower this to 50 words or disable it completely. Also make sure you're on a supported AI platform (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, or Grok).

**"It created a .txt file instead of .py for my Python code. How do I fix this?"**

The extension analyzes your code patterns to detect the language. For better detection, either use code fences like ```python in your text, or manually set the file format in the extension settings.

**"Does this work on all AI platforms?"**

Currently supports ChatGPT (both chat.openai.com and chatgpt.com), Claude (claude.ai), Google Gemini, DeepSeek, and Grok. Each platform has slightly different file upload systems, so the extension adapts accordingly.

**"I'm worried about privacy. What data do you collect?"**

By default, nothing. There's an optional analytics feature (disabled by default) that only tracks basic usage like "file created" - no content, no personal data. You can see exactly what's collected in the extension popup.

**"Can I turn off the automatic file creation?"**

Yes! You can disable auto-detection and use the manual "Save as File" button, or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+S. You can also add a delay with a cancel button.

**"Claude already has paste-to-file. Why do I need this?"**

Claude's feature is basic. This extension adds smart language detection, customizable word thresholds, batch processing, and works consistently across all AI platforms. You can also disable the extension on Claude if you prefer their native feature.

**"Does it support shell scripts and custom file extensions?"**

Yes! Version 1.1.0 added support for .sh files and custom file extensions. You can choose from 20+ built-in formats or specify your own custom extension for specialized file types.

**"Why can't I see the analytics dashboard?"**

The analytics dashboard is only visible when anonymous usage analytics is enabled in settings. This ensures no data is processed unless you explicitly opt in. Enable it in the extension popup under Privacy settings to see your usage insights.
