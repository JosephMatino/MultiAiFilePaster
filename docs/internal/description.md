Multi-AI File Paster automatically attaches and converts pasted text into file attachments for ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, and Grok. When you paste code or documents into these AI platforms, the extension creates properly formatted files with correct extensions and syntax highlighting.

The extension combines two powerful features that work together seamlessly. Auto-attach creates file attachments when your pasted content exceeds your word threshold (default 500 words, adjustable from 50 to 15,000 words). Auto-convert detects the programming language or file type from your content and assigns the correct file extension automatically. You paste normally and the extension handles everything in the background without interrupting your workflow.

Automatic File Creation

Set your preferred word threshold (default 500 words, adjustable from 50 to 15,000) and the extension does the rest. Paste your content and it transforms into a proper file attachment automatically. The extension analyzes your content type and creates files with correct extensions.

Smart Language Detection

Recognizes 30+ programming languages and file formats including JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C++, C#, Go, Rust, Ruby, PHP, Swift, Kotlin, Dart, Scala, R, Perl, Lua, Shell scripts, SQL, HTML, CSS, JSON, XML, YAML, CSV, Markdown, and more. Files automatically receive the correct extension with proper MIME type declarations for optimal platform compatibility.

Automatic Content Splitting

When you paste multiple code blocks together, the extension detects each one and creates separate files automatically. Perfect for sharing projects with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together. Splits large content into multiple files to avoid character limits. Each section becomes its own properly formatted file with intelligent content splitting.

Complete Privacy

All processing happens entirely on your device. Your code and documents never leave your computer. No accounts required, no subscriptions, no data collection. Everything works locally in your browser with zero external data transmission.

Manual Override

Press Ctrl+Shift+S (Cmd+Shift+S on Mac) or click the extension button to create files instantly, regardless of content length. Perfect when you need immediate file creation without waiting for automatic detection.

Optional Analytics

Track your usage with local statistics showing files created, platform usage, and file format trends. All data stays on your device with no external transmission. This feature is completely optional and disabled by default for maximum privacy.

International Support

Available in 11 languages including English, Arabic, Swahili, Spanish, Japanese, French, Russian, Chinese, Portuguese, German, and Hindi. The interface automatically adapts to your browser language or you can manually select your preferred language from settings.

Who Benefits

Developers can share complete component files, API implementations, database schemas, and configuration files without hitting 4,000 character paste limits. Get instant code reviews and optimization suggestions with properly formatted files that maintain syntax highlighting.

Data scientists can share large datasets, complex SQL queries, and analysis scripts seamlessly. CSV files with thousands of rows and Python data processing scripts become instantly shareable with correct formatting and proper encoding.

Technical writers can share documentation drafts, API guides, and tutorials exceeding standard character limits. Markdown files with code examples maintain perfect formatting and syntax highlighting across all platforms.

Students and educators can share programming assignments, project files, and learning materials without compression tools. Get help with multi-file projects instantly with automatic file organization and proper formatting.

Customization Options

Adjust word count triggers from 50 to 15,000 words to match your workflow. Enable optional countdown delay (1 to 15 seconds) with cancel button for review time before file creation. Choose automatic language detection or manually select from 30+ supported file types. Customize behavior for each AI platform individually or disable on specific platforms. Configure processing delays and language detection settings for optimal performance.

Privacy and Security

All operations happen on your device using your browser. No content gets transmitted to external servers. Optional usage tracking (disabled by default) only records basic events like file created and never stores actual content, file names, or sensitive information. Settings use Chrome's secure storage and no personal information leaves your device. Built with Manifest V3 security standards using minimal permissions.

Supported File Formats

Programming Languages include JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, C++, C, Go, Rust, Ruby, PHP, Swift, Kotlin, Dart, Scala, Perl, Lua, R, MATLAB, and Shell scripts (bash, zsh, sh). Web Technologies include HTML, CSS, SCSS, SASS, LESS, JSON, XML, and templates for React, Vue, and Angular. Data and Configuration files include SQL, CSV, YAML, TOML, INI, and environment files. Documentation formats include Markdown, reStructuredText, LaTeX, and plain text. You can also specify custom extensions for specialized formats.

How to Use

Install the extension, open any supported AI platform, and paste your large code file or document. The extension automatically detects the content type and creates a file attachment with proper MIME type and UTF-8 encoding. Your conversation continues with properly organized files instead of overwhelming text blocks. Use the keyboard shortcut anytime for instant file creation or adjust settings to match your preferences.

Troubleshooting

If file attachment fails, refresh the AI platform page and clear browser cache. Check that the extension has proper permissions in Chrome settings. Most platform specific issues resolve by disabling and re-enabling the extension for that platform. For shell scripts with special characters, the extension uses proper UTF-8 encoding to preserve emojis and box-drawing characters.

Browser Compatibility

Works on all Chromium based browsers including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge (version 88 and above), Brave Browser, and Opera (version 74 and above). Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.

Updates and Support

Regular updates ensure compatibility with AI platform changes and new features. Active development maintains support for all five platforms with prompt fixes for any platform-specific issues. Community feedback drives continuous improvement and feature additions.
