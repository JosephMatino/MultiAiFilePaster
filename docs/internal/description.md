**Multi-AI File Paster** is a free Chrome extension that solves a common workflow problem for developers, writers, and anyone working with large text content on AI platforms like **ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, and DeepSeek**.

**The Problem:** You have a large code file, long document, or substantial text content that you want to share with an AI platform for help, review, or analysis. When you try to paste it directly, you run into character limits, formatting issues, or the platform simply won't accept such large content. This forces you to either break your content into small pieces (losing context) or manually create a text file, save it to your computer, then upload it - a time-consuming process that interrupts your workflow.

**Real Examples:** Debugging a 500-line JavaScript file, analyzing SQL database schemas, reviewing API documentation, sharing configuration files, getting help with Python scripts, or working with large datasets. These are common scenarios where you need AI assistance but can't simply paste your content.

**The Solution:** Multi-AI File Paster automatically detects when your pasted text content exceeds practical limits (default 500 words, customizable) or would benefit from file formatting. Instead of forcing you through the manual file creation process, the extension instantly converts your pasted text into a properly formatted file attachment with the correct file extension and syntax highlighting. You paste your text normally, and the extension handles all the technical details of creating and attaching the file.

**How It Works:**

ü§ñ **Multi-Ai Platform Support:** The extension works across five major AI platforms - **ChatGPT** (both chat.openai.com and chatgpt.com), **Claude** (claude.ai), **Google Gemini** (gemini.google.com), **DeepSeek** (chat.deepseek.com), and **Grok** (grok.com). When you paste content that exceeds the default threshold (500 words, but customizable from 50 to 15,000 words), it automatically converts your paste into a clean file attachment.

üìù **Smart Language Detection:** The extension analyzes your content and recognizes over 20 programming languages and file formats including JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, C++, C, Go, Rust, Ruby, PHP, HTML, CSS, JSON, XML, SQL, CSV, Markdown, Shell scripts, and plain text. It automatically applies the correct file extension and enables proper syntax highlighting in the AI platform. You can also specify custom file extensions for specialized formats.

üîí **Privacy-First Architecture:** All processing happens entirely on your device. Your code, documents, and text content never leave your computer or get transmitted to external servers. The extension operates completely offline for content processing, with internet only required to access the AI platforms themselves. No accounts, subscriptions, data collection, or hidden costs.

**Direct Integration:** The extension integrates directly with each AI platform's existing file upload system. It doesn't change how the platforms look or work - it simply automates the file creation and attachment process that you would otherwise do manually. The result is a clean, organized conversation with properly formatted file attachments instead of messy text blocks.

‚ú® **Perfect for:**
‚Ä¢ **Developers** who need to share code with AI platforms
‚Ä¢ **Writers** working with long documents
‚Ä¢ **Researchers** analyzing data
‚Ä¢ **Students** working on projects
‚Ä¢ **Anyone** who regularly uses AI platforms for help with large text content

‚ö° **Easy installation:** Add it from the Chrome Web Store with one click. **No setup required, no configuration needed.** It starts working immediately after installation.

The extension uses several permissions to provide this functionality. It needs activeTab permission to detect when you are on supported AI platforms and inject the file attachment feature. Storage permission saves your preferences locally on your device. Alarms permission handles cleanup of temporary files. Host permissions allow access to the specific AI platform websites where the extension provides its functionality.

All data stays on your device. No personal information is collected. No usage tracking. No data sent to external servers. Your privacy is completely protected.

This is a free extension with no premium features, no subscriptions, and no hidden costs. Everything is included at no charge.

**Detailed Feature Overview:**

**Automatic File Creation:** When you paste content that meets the word threshold, the extension instantly creates a file with the appropriate extension (.js for JavaScript, .py for Python, .sql for database queries, etc.) and attaches it to your AI conversation. This happens in under one second with no user intervention required.

**Manual Save Option:** For shorter content or when you want immediate file creation regardless of length, use the manual save feature. Click the "Attach typed text as file" button in the extension popup or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+S to instantly convert your current text into a file attachment.

**Analytics Dashboard:** Track usage with statistics including total files created, platform usage breakdowns, file format trends, and daily usage patterns. View data for the last 7, 30, or 90 days, or see all-time statistics. Export data for external analysis. Includes compression statistics, batch processing metrics, and performance insights. All analytics are optional and work locally‚Äîno data leaves your device.

**Customizable Settings:** Adjust the word count threshold anywhere from 50 to 15,000 words to match your workflow. Enable a smart delay feature (1-15 seconds) with a cancel button if you want time to review before file creation. Choose between automatic format detection or manually select your preferred file type from over 20 supported formats. Configure compression settings with customizable thresholds and enable batch processing for multiple code blocks.

**Advanced Batch Processing:** The extension automatically detects multiple code blocks in pasted text and creates separate files for each block. Perfect for multi-file projects where you paste content containing ```javascript, ```python, and ```css blocks - each becomes its own properly formatted file with correct extensions and syntax highlighting.

**File Compression:** GZIP compression reduces large file attachments by 60-80% using browser-native compression. Configurable threshold (512-10240 bytes) with automatic compression ratio validation and user feedback. Large files are automatically compressed to improve upload speed and reduce storage requirements.

**Platform-Specific Optimization:** Each AI platform has different file upload mechanisms, and the extension adapts accordingly. For ChatGPT, it uses the standard file upload button. For Claude, you can choose between the platform's native paste-to-file feature or the extension's enhanced functionality. For Gemini, it handles both file input and drag-drop scenarios. DeepSeek and Grok integration uses their respective file input systems.

**Error Handling and Recovery:** The extension includes clear error handling with specific messages. If file attachment fails, it provides guidance on how to resolve the issue, including platform-specific troubleshooting steps.

**Privacy and Security Features:**

**Complete Local Processing:** All language detection, file creation, and content analysis happens entirely on your device. The extension never transmits your content to external servers, ensuring complete privacy for sensitive code, proprietary documents, or confidential information.

**Optional Analytics:** The extension includes completely optional, privacy-safe analytics that only track basic usage patterns like "file created" or "error occurred" - never the actual content. This feature is disabled by default and requires explicit user consent to enable.

**Secure Storage:** All settings and preferences are stored locally using Chrome's encrypted storage APIs. No personal information, browsing history, or content is ever stored or transmitted.

**Chrome Manifest V3 Compliance:** Built using the latest Chrome extension security standards with minimal permissions and strict content security policies to prevent any security vulnerabilities.
