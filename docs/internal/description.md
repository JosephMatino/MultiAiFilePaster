# Multi-AI File Paster - Chrome Web Store Description

**Transform large text into clean file attachments across ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, and Grok**

Multi-AI File Paster is a free Chrome extension that eliminates the frustration of sharing large code files, documents, and datasets with AI platforms. Instead of hitting character limits or dealing with broken formatting, the extension automatically converts your pasted content into properly formatted file attachments with correct syntax highlighting.

## The Problem We Solve

When working with AI platforms, you often need to share substantial content like debugging a 500-line JavaScript file, analyzing SQL database schemas, reviewing API documentation, or working with large datasets. Direct pasting typically results in character limits, formatting issues, or complete rejection by the platform. This forces you to manually create text files, save them to your computer, then upload through each platform's file system - a tedious workflow that breaks your productivity flow.

## Our Solution

Multi-AI File Paster automatically detects when your pasted content exceeds practical limits (default 500 words, fully customizable from 50-15,000 words) and instantly converts it into a properly formatted file attachment. You paste normally, and the extension handles all file creation and attachment automatically.

## Key Features

**Multi-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly across ChatGPT (chat.openai.com, chatgpt.com), Claude (claude.ai), Google Gemini (gemini.google.com), DeepSeek (chat.deepseek.com), and Grok (grok.com).

**Smart Language Detection**: Automatically recognizes over 20 programming languages and file formats including JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, C++, Go, Rust, Ruby, PHP, HTML, CSS, JSON, XML, SQL, CSV, Markdown, and Shell scripts. Custom file extensions are supported for specialized formats.

**Batch Processing**: Automatically detects multiple code blocks in pasted text and creates separate files for each block. Perfect for multi-file projects containing javascript, python, and css code blocks.

**File Compression**: GZIP compression reduces large file attachments by 60 to 80 percent using browser compression with configurable thresholds.

**Privacy First Design**: All processing happens entirely on your device. Your code and documents never leave your computer or get transmitted to external servers. No accounts, subscriptions, or data collection required.

**Analytics Dashboard**: Optional usage tracking shows total files created, platform breakdowns, file format trends, and daily patterns. Completely local with no external data transmission.

**Manual Controls**: Use Ctrl+Shift+S (Cmd+Shift+S on Mac) or the "Attach typed text as file" button for immediate file creation regardless of content length.

## How It Works

**Automatic Detection**: When you paste content exceeding your configured word threshold (default 500 words), the extension instantly analyzes the content type and creates a properly formatted file attachment with the correct extension (.js, .py, .sql, etc.).

**Smart Processing**: Advanced pattern recognition determines the most suitable file format. Multiple code blocks are automatically separated into individual files, perfect for multi-file projects.

**Seamless Integration**: The extension works directly with each platform's existing file upload system without changing the interface. Your conversations stay clean and organized with properly formatted attachments instead of overwhelming text blocks.
