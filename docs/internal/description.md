Multi-AI File Paster automatically converts large pasted content into clean file attachments for AI platforms. When you paste code, documents, or data that exceeds your word limit, the extension instantly creates a properly formatted file with correct syntax highlighting. No more character limits, broken formatting, or manual file creation.

This extension detects when your pasted content is too large and converts it into a file attachment that AI platforms can process easily. You paste normally and the extension handles everything automatically. Works seamlessly with ChatGPT, Claude, Google Gemini, DeepSeek, and Grok.

Automatic File Creation

Set your preferred word threshold (default 500 words, adjustable from 50 to 15,000) and the extension does the rest. Paste your content and it transforms into a proper file attachment automatically. The extension analyzes your content type and creates files with correct extensions.

Smart Language Detection

Recognizes over 40 programming languages and file formats including JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C++, C#, Go, Rust, Ruby, PHP, Shell scripts, SQL, JSON, YAML, CSV, Markdown, and many more. Files automatically receive the correct extension with proper MIME type declarations for optimal platform compatibility.

Batch Processing

When you paste multiple code blocks together, the extension detects each one and creates separate files automatically. Perfect for sharing projects with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together. Each section becomes its own properly formatted file with intelligent content splitting.

Complete Privacy

All processing happens entirely on your device. Your code and documents never leave your computer. No accounts required, no subscriptions, no data collection. Everything works locally in your browser with zero external data transmission.

Manual Override

Press Ctrl+Shift+S (Cmd+Shift+S on Mac) or click the extension button to create files instantly, regardless of content length. Perfect when you need immediate file creation without waiting for automatic detection.

Optional Analytics

Track your usage with local statistics showing files created, platform usage, and file format trends. All data stays on your device with no external transmission. This feature is completely optional and disabled by default for maximum privacy.

International Support

Available in 11 languages including English, Arabic, Swahili, Spanish, Japanese, French, Russian, Chinese, Portuguese, German, and Hindi. The interface automatically adapts to your browser language or you can manually select your preferred language from settings.

Who Benefits

Developers can share complete component files, API implementations, database schemas, and configuration files without hitting paste limits. Get code reviews and optimization suggestions faster with properly formatted files.

Data scientists can share large datasets, complex SQL queries, and analysis scripts seamlessly. CSV files with thousands of rows and Python data processing scripts become instantly shareable with correct formatting.

Technical writers can share documentation drafts, API guides, and tutorials exceeding standard limits. Markdown files with code examples maintain perfect formatting and syntax highlighting.

Students and educators can share programming assignments, project files, and learning materials easily. Get help with multi-file projects without complex file management or compression tools.

Customization Options

Adjust word count triggers from 50 to 15,000 words to match your workflow. Enable optional countdown delay (1 to 15 seconds) with cancel button for review time before file creation. Choose automatic language detection or manually select from over 40 supported file types. Customize behavior for each AI platform individually or disable on specific platforms. Configure processing delays and language detection settings for optimal performance.

Privacy and Security

All operations happen on your device using your browser. No content gets transmitted to external servers. Optional usage tracking (disabled by default) only records basic events like file created and never stores actual content, file names, or sensitive information. Settings use Chrome's secure storage and no personal information leaves your device. Built with Manifest V3 security standards using minimal permissions.

Supported File Formats

Programming Languages include JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, C++, C, Go, Rust, Ruby, PHP, Swift, Kotlin, Dart, Scala, Perl, Lua, R, MATLAB, and Shell scripts (bash, zsh, sh). Web Technologies include HTML, CSS, SCSS, SASS, LESS, JSON, XML, and templates for React, Vue, and Angular. Data and Configuration files include SQL, CSV, YAML, TOML, INI, and environment files. Documentation formats include Markdown, reStructuredText, LaTeX, and plain text. You can also specify custom extensions for specialized formats.

How to Use

Install the extension, open any supported AI platform, and paste your large code file or document. The extension automatically detects the content type and creates a file attachment with proper MIME type and UTF-8 encoding. Your conversation continues with properly organized files instead of overwhelming text blocks. Use the keyboard shortcut anytime for instant file creation or adjust settings to match your preferences.

Troubleshooting

If file attachment fails, refresh the AI platform page and clear browser cache. Check that the extension has proper permissions in Chrome settings. Most platform specific issues resolve by disabling and re-enabling the extension for that platform. For shell scripts with special characters, the extension uses proper UTF-8 encoding to preserve emojis and box-drawing characters.

Browser Compatibility

Works on all Chromium based browsers including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge (version 88 and above), Brave Browser, and Opera (version 74 and above). Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.
