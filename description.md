**Multi-AI File Paster** is a free Chrome extension that solves a simple but annoying problem: when you have large code files, long documents, or big text content that you want to share with **ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, or DeepSeek**, but the platform will not let you paste it directly.

You are working on a project and you have a large piece of code, a long document, or text that you need help with. You try to paste it into your AI platform, but it is too long, hits character limits, or just does not work properly. So you end up either breaking it into tiny pieces or manually creating a text file, saving it to your computer, then uploading it. It wastes time and breaks your flow.

Think about debugging a **500-line JavaScript file**, working with **SQL queries**, or reviewing **API documentation**. You need AI help, but you cannot just paste it because it is too big or the formatting gets messed up.

Multi-AI File Paster automatically detects when your paste is too large or would work better as a file attachment. Instead of you having to manually create files, our extension does it instantly. Just paste normally and we handle the rest.

ü§ñ **Works across five major AI platforms:** When you paste large content on **ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, or DeepSeek**, it automatically converts your paste into a properly formatted file attachment.

üìù **Smart language detection:** The extension recognizes **20+ programming languages** including JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, C++, HTML, CSS, SQL, and many others, plus supports **custom file formats**. It applies the correct syntax highlighting and file extension automatically.

üîí **Complete privacy:** Everything happens on your device. Your code and documents never get sent to external servers. All processing is done locally in your browser for complete privacy and security. **No accounts needed, no subscriptions, no hidden costs.**

The extension integrates seamlessly with each AI platform. It looks and feels like a native feature, not an add-on. You will not notice any difference in how the platforms work, except now you can paste large files without any hassle.
